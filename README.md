# F-Taxes

F-Taxes is a free and open source crypto tax calculation tool.
It strives to be an alternative to the dozens of overpriced online services.

Advantages:
- Very fast in comparison with online services as it runs locally on your PC instead of in the cloud.
- All your data stays under your control.
- No transaction limits.
- Open source, extensible by the community.
- Free, because paying taxes sucks already enough.

F-Taxes is very, very early stage and not usable yet. Feel free to run the app yourself and tinker with it though.

**Warning:** While you could self-host this app on a webspace it's strongly recommended to NOT do that.
The reason is that the software is very early stage and is missing A LOT of the typical
security mechanisms to have it accessible to the outside world in a safe as possible way.
